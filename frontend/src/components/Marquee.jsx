/**
 * Infinite horizontal scroll of chips/cards — the "marquee" pattern from
 * Magic UI's component gallery (https://magicui.design), hand-built with
 * a plain CSS keyframe (`.animate-marquee` in index.css) rather than
 * pulling in their package, since the whole effect is really just "render
 * the content twice, side by side, and slide the wrapper left by exactly
 * one copy's width, forever." Pauses on hover (`group-hover:paused`) so a
 * visitor can actually read an item instead of chasing it.
 *
 * LandingPage.jsx uses this for a strip of real feature highlights
 * instead of customer logos — there are no real customer logos yet (see
 * LandingPage.jsx's top docstring on placeholder content), and a logo
 * marquee with invented company names would be actively misleading in a
 * way a feature-highlight marquee isn't.

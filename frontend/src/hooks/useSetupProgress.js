/**
 * The six-step journey from a brand-new section to a generated timetable
 * (periods -> subjects -> teachers -> this section's plan -> constraints
 * (optional) -> generate), as real counts read from App.jsx's own live
 * state. Used by both the always-visible header progress bar (App.jsx)
 * and the detailed step list (OverviewTab.jsx) so the two can never drift
 * apart — before this, OverviewTab computed its own steps locally and the
 * header had no equivalent at all, meaning progress was invisible on
 * every tab except Overview, which is where a new admin spends the least
 * time (the actual setup work happens on Data Entry and Constraints).
 *
 * Subjects and teachers are two separate steps, not one combined
 * "subjects & teachers" step — they're two separate pages in Data Entry
 * (SubjectsSection.jsx / TeachersSection.jsx) now, so the progress
 * tracking matches the real structure of the work instead of glossing
 * over it.

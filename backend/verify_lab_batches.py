"""
One-off verification script for lab-batch splitting (Subject.lab_batch_count).
Not part of the test suite — run manually: python verify_lab_batches.py

Builds a small in-memory SQLite school: one class group, a normal subject
(Math) and a lab subject split into 3 batches (Programming Lab), 3 teachers
qualified for the lab, one teacher for Math, a handful of periods and rooms.
Asserts:
  - generation succeeds (optimal/feasible)
  - the lab subject produces exactly 3 simultaneous entries per session,
    all at the same period, each with a distinct teacher
  - no teacher is double-booked anywhere in the result
  - batches get distinct rooms when enough lab-type rooms exist

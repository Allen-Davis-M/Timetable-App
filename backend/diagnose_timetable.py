"""
Read-only diagnostic: dumps everything the solver looks at for every
school in the database, and flags common reasons generation would be
infeasible:

  - a class group whose total periods/week (summed across its subject
    requirements) exceeds the number of periods that exist
  - more than one class group with the same name/grade (a possible sign
    of an accidental duplicate section)
  - a subject requirement with zero qualified teachers
  - a teacher whose combined periods/week across all their subjects
    exceeds their own max_periods_per_week

Doesn't change anything — safe to run anytime, including while the
backend server is running.

Usage (from the backend/ folder, with your venv active):

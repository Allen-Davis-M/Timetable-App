"""
One-off cleanup script: removes duplicate subject_requirements rows caused
by a since-fixed frontend race condition (see DataEntryTab.jsx and
app/routers/class_groups.py for the fix).

For each (class_group_id, subject_id) pair with more than one row, this
keeps the MOST RECENTLY UPDATED one (highest id, since rows are only ever
inserted or updated in place) and deletes the rest.

Usage (from the backend/ folder, with your venv active):
    python dedupe_requirements.py

Safe to run multiple times — if there are no duplicates, it does nothing.
Stop the backend server first so nothing else is writing to dev.db while
this runs.

"""
Tests for app/services/bulk_import.py — the two design choices that carry
the whole feature (see its module docstring): best-effort per-row error
handling (one bad row doesn't block the rest of the file) and upsert-by-
name (re-uploading after fixing a typo updates rather than duplicates).

Exercises the service functions directly rather than through the
multipart-upload HTTP endpoint — the parsing/import logic is what this
feature is actually about; the endpoint itself is a thin wrapper (see
app/routers/subjects.py's bulk_import_subjects) that just calls
parse_rows() then the matching import_* function.

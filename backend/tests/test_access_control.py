"""
Tests for app/core/access.py's require_school_access, exercised through
real router endpoints rather than calling the function directly — the
actual risk this closes (see docs/ARCHITECTURE.md's "Multiple admins per
school..." section) is a router forgetting to call it or getting the
school_id wrong, which a unit test on access.py alone wouldn't catch.

Covers, per the documented role model (owner/admin implicit, viewer
read-only, no relationship at all -> 404 not 403):
  - A user with no relationship to a school gets 404 from a resource
    endpoint, not a 403 or a 200 with someone else's data.
  - A viewer (added via accepting an invite) can read but gets 403 on a
    write endpoint.
  - An invited admin can write normally.
  - Only an admin can see the members/invites list; a viewer gets 403.

"""
Tests for app/routers/constraints.py's direct-create/update/reparse CRUD
and its conflict-detection helpers (_find_placement_conflicts,
_find_day_conflicts) — exercised through POST/PUT /api/constraints
directly (skipping /parse's LLM-first/regex-fallback text parsing
entirely, since ConstraintCreate already accepts type/parameters
directly; the parsing pipeline itself is a separate concern from what
these endpoints do with an already-resolved constraint).

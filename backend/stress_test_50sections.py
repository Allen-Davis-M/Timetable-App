"""
Stress test: generate a timetable for a school with 50+ sections, using a
*realistic* teacher assignment structure rather than a fully-symmetric
worst case (every teacher qualified for every subject/section) — real
schools have natural variation (subject teachers are assigned per grade
band, not shared across the whole school), which is much friendlier to
the solver than a deliberately adversarial fully-symmetric instance.

Structure: 10 grades x 5 sections = 50 sections. Each grade has its own
dedicated pool of 2 teachers per subject (8 subjects), so teachers aren't
shared across grades — this mirrors how Indian schools typically staff
larger campuses (a "Grade 6-8 wing" teacher roster, etc).

Not part of the app itself — a one-off diagnostic script, run directly
with `python3 stress_test_50sections.py`.

"""
School-membership access control — the fix for a real gap that existed
until now: every router except schools.py took a bare `school_id` (or a
resource id it belongs to) and trusted it completely, with no check that
the logged-in user actually had anything to do with that school. Any
authenticated user could read or write any other school's data just by
changing an id in the request.

This module is deliberately plain functions called explicitly inside each
endpoint, not a single FastAPI `Depends()` — because school_id shows up in
three different shapes across the existing routers (a query param on list
endpoints, a body field on create endpoints, or not at all on
get/update/delete endpoints that only take a resource id and need it
looked up from the fetched row first). A single dependency can't cleanly
cover all three without a bigger refactor of every endpoint's signature,
so `require_school_access` takes school_id as a plain argument and each
router calls it wherever it already has that id in hand.

Role model: two tiers. "admin" can do everything a school's owner could;
"viewer" can only read. The school's owner (School.owner_id) is always an
implicit admin, so a freshly created school with no SchoolMembership rows
at all still works exactly as before this feature existed — memberships
only matter for *additional* users beyond the owner.

    code. Raises 403 when the user has *some* access but not enough (a

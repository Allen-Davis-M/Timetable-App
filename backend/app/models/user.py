    A one-time, short-lived token for the forgot-password flow (see
    app/routers/auth.py's forgot_password/reset_password endpoints). Kept
    as its own table rather than columns on User (the pattern SchoolInvite
    uses for the same reason): a user can request multiple resets over
    time, and this way old ones just pile up as harmless rows instead of
    needing to be overwritten in place.

    `used` is set True the moment a token is redeemed, so a leaked/reused
    reset link (e.g. from an email forwarded or left open in a browser
    tab) can't reset the password a second time even before `expires_at`.
    Works for Google-only accounts too (hashed_password null) — resetting
    just sets a password, giving that account an email/password login
    option alongside Google sign-in, rather than requiring one to exist
    already.

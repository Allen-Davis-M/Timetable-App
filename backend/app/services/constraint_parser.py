"""
Turns a plain-English scheduling constraint into a structured constraint.

This is a pattern-matching parser, not an LLM call — it recognizes a fixed
set of common phrasings well enough to be useful without needing an API key
or external service. It is NOT a general NLP system: unusual phrasing falls
through to a generic "scheduling_rule" bucket that's recorded but not
enforced by the solver.

Swapping this for a real LLM-based parser (e.g. calling Claude) later is a
drop-in replacement: same input (text, known teacher/subject names), same
output shape (ParsedConstraint), so nothing else has to change.

What's actually enforced by the solver today (see app/routers/constraints.py
for how each type gets turned into something the solver reads, and
app/services/solver.py for where it's applied):
  - "workload_limit" — teacher + a period count found -> sets
    Teacher.max_periods_per_week.
  - "availability" — teacher + a day of the week found -> adds that day's
    periods to Teacher.unavailable_period_ids.
  - "no_subject_period" — subject + "first period"/"last period" +
    negation ("should not", "can't", "never", ...) found -> excludes that
    subject from the first/last period of every day.
  - "require_subject_period" — subject + "first period"/"last period"
    with NO negation ("should be", "must be", "always", ...) found ->
    restricts that subject to *only* the first/last period of every day.
  - "subject_sequence" — "<subject B> can't/shouldn't/must not
    immediately follow <subject A>" -> forbids subject B from being
    scheduled in the period right after subject A, for the same class,
    on any day.
  - "no_subject_day" / "require_subject_day" — a subject tied to (or
    banned from) a specific day of the week, e.g. "No PE on Fridays" /
    "Math should be on Mondays". Same require/exclude-by-negation
    detection as the first/last-period pattern above, but for a whole day
    instead of one position.
  - "max_consecutive_periods" — "no more than N periods in a row" /
    "N consecutive periods" / "N periods back-to-back", tied to whichever
    of a subject or a teacher is named in the sentence (subject: caps how
    many of that subject can run back-to-back for a class; teacher: caps
    how many periods that teacher can teach back-to-back, any subject).
  - "min_gap_between_subjects" — "leave at least N periods between X and
    Y" / "X and Y must be at least N periods apart" -> forbids the two
    named subjects from landing within N periods of each other on the
    same day, for the same class.
  - "scheduling_rule" — the catch-all for everything else. Recorded, shown
    in the UI, but not applied to the solve. Still a real gap: things like
    per-class-only rules phrased unusually aren't recognized yet. A
    subject/teacher name that doesn't exactly match (or substring-match)
    an existing Subject/Teacher name in the school also falls through
    here — add the subject/teacher first, then the constraint.
